  **Key Concepts:**
  - **Spread**: The price difference between exchanges
  - **Slippage**: Price changes during trade execution
  - **Gas Fees**: Transaction costs on DEXs (Ethereum network)
  - **Confidence**: Our assessment of opportunity reliability
  
  **Safety Tips:**
  - Always start with dry-run mode
  - Understand fees before executing
  - Never invest more than you can afford to lose
  - Monitor market conditions actively
  - Start with small position sizes
  
  **Try These Commands:**
